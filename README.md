# Eulers Method for Projectiles
This is a porfolio project assigned to me by my university.
The task was to create code that used eulers numerical method to simulate a projectile 
I then compared it to standard SUVAT equations.
The final part was to use the code for the projectile to simulate a ball bouncing plotted as height vs time
